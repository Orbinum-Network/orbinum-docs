# Distributed Model Sharding Framework

The **Distributed Model Sharding Framework (DMSF)** framework enables Orbinum to efficiently manage AI models through **on-chain fragmentation, training, storage, validation, and execution**. This system ensures **decentralization, scalability, and security**, preventing any single entity from controlling the AI model lifecycle.  

DMS is fundamental to Orbinumâ€™s **fault-tolerant, high-availability AI infrastructure**, leveraging validator nodes to store and reconstruct models in a **distributed and verifiable manner**.  

---

## How DMSF Works in Orbinum

DMS follows a structured process to manage AI models securely and efficiently:  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Model Registration & Indexing

When a new AI model is submitted:

- A **unique `model_id`** is assigned.
- The model **metadata is stored immutably** on the blockchain.
- A **validation index** tracks the modelâ€™s lifecycle.

*This ensures that every AI model in Orbinum is verifiable and securely recorded.* 

```json
{
  "type": "register_model",
  "model_id": "ai_model_XYZ",
  "owner": "user_123",
  "validation_status": "pending",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-05T12:00:00Z"
}
```

 ### ðŸ”¹ 2. Federated Learning & Local Model Training

Instead of training models centrally, Orbinum uses federated learning to distribute training across multiple decentralized nodes:

- Nodes train AI models using their local datasets.
- Raw data is never shared, ensuring privacy and compliance with security principles.
- Each model remains localized and fragmented within its respective nod

```json
{
    "type": "local_model_training",
    "node_id": "neural_node_001",
    "model_id": "ai_model_local_xyz",
    "dataset_location": "/path/to/local/dataset",
    "algorithm": "FederatedAveraging",
    "parameters": {
        "epochs": 10,
        "batch_size": 32,
        "learning_rate": 0.001
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-07-20T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Model Fragmentation & Blockchain Storage

Once trained, models are split into optimized shards for decentralized storage using DMS:

- Each shard is encoded, hashed, and stored on-chain.
- Cryptographic proofs prevent tampering or unauthorized modifications.
- Shards are linked to their `model_id` for future reconstruction.

```json
{
  "type": "store_model_shard",
  "shard_id": "shard_123",
  "model_id": "ai_model_XYZ",
  "data": "base64_encoded_shard_data",
  "hash": "abc123def456",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-05T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Shard Validation & Auditing

To maintain data integrity, the validator:

- Recalculates and compares shard hashes to detect inconsistencies.
- Automatically rejects or revalidates altered or corrupted shards.
- Ensures that only verified shards remain available for reconstruction.

*This prevents unauthorized modifications and guarantees the authenticity of AI models.*

```json
{
  "type": "validate_shard",
  "shard_id": "shard_123",
  "validator_node": "node_45B",
  "status": "approved",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-05T12:30:00Z"
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Decentralized Model Execution

When a model needs to be executed:

- The validator retrieves, reconstructs the model from its shards, and verifies its integrity.
- The AI model is distributed across nodes for execution.
- Parallel processing optimizes execution speed while ensuring correctness.
- Final results are securely returned to the requesting user.

*This ensures models can be executed efficiently in a decentralized way.*

```json
{
  "type": "execute_model",
  "model_id": "ai_model_XYZ",
  "execution_nodes": ["exec_1A", "exec_2B", "exec_3C"],
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-05T13:00:00Z"
}
```

## **Privacy and Security Mechanisms**  

To maintain the integrity of AI models while ensuring privacy, Orbinum implements the following security measures:  

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) â†’ Allow model verification without revealing training data or updates. Ensure that contributions are valid while preserving privacy.  
- Homomorphic Encryption â†’ Enables AI computations to occur directly on encrypted data, ensuring privacy at all stages of training and execution.  
- Differential Privacy â†’ Introduces mathematical noise into model updates to prevent identity tracing or dataset reconstruction attacks.  
- Model Integrity Validation â†’ Each model update is validated before being stored to prevent low-quality or biased updates. Any invalid or tampered updates are automatically rejected or require revalidation.  

---

## Fault-Tolerant & Decentralized Model Management
DMS integrates redundancy and fault-tolerance mechanisms to ensure AI model availability:

- Automatic Failover â†’ If a validator node goes offline, another node takes over shard verification and execution.
- Reallocation of Computation Tasks â†’ Failed AI executions trigger automatic reassignment of tasks.
- Slashing Mechanisms â†’ Nodes that repeatedly fail or attempt to tamper with stored models face penalties and removal.

*These safeguards guarantee that AI models remain accessible, verifiable, and resistant to failures.*

## **Why Orbinumâ€™s Federated Learning is Unique**  

- No centralized AI model â†’ Each model remains fragmented and decentralized.  
- Stronger security â†’ Cryptographic validation ensures integrity of model updates.  
- Optimized AI execution â†’ Sharded models allow scalable and parallel computing.  
- Fully private AI training â†’ Raw data never leaves the ownerâ€™s node.
