# Economy Model

The Orbinum Network's economic engine is powered by its native utility token, **ON**, which serves as the primary medium for incentivizing participation, facilitating transactions, and enabling governance within the decentralized AI ecosystem. Orbinum employs a hybrid tokenomics model, transitioning from an initial deflationary phase to a controlled inflationary phase to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Initial Deflationary Phase

In the early stages of the network (approximately the first decade), Orbinum operates under a deflationary model with a fixed total token supply. During this period, ON tokens are gradually allocated through a carefully designed reward system to incentivize Validators, Nominators, and Contributors based on their contributions to network security and AI model support. The precise distribution percentages across these participant groups are determined and adaptable by the community through decentralized governance. The rate of token distribution will gradually decrease over this initial phase.

**Initial Token Distribution:**

According to an earlier design, the total initial supply of ON tokens was set at 1,000,000,000, with the following initial distribution:

* 40% for participants (Validators, Nominators, and Contributors): 400,000,000 ON, distributed over 10 years.
* 20% for ecosystem development: 200,000,000 ON.
* 15% for team and advisors: 150,000,000 ON (with a 4-year vesting period).
* 15% for initial token sale: 150,000,000 ON.
* 10% for reserve fund: 100,000,000 ON.

>*Please note that the current distribution strategy is subject to the community's decisions through decentralized governance and may differ from this initial plan.*

## Transition to Inflationary Phase

Following the initial deflationary period, the network will transition to a controlled inflationary model. At this point, the community will collectively agree on the annual rate of new ON token issuance. These newly generated tokens will continue to incentivize Validators, Nominators, and Contributors for their ongoing participation.

**Annual Emission Cap and Dynamic Adjustment:**

The initial target for the annual emission cap (inflation rate) is around 3% of the total circulating supply. This cap serves as the default rate for new token issuance in the inflationary phase. However, this figure is not fixed and will be subject to adjustments based on community decisions made through the decentralized governance process. The actual emission within this cap may also be dynamically adjusted based on network activity and economic conditions, as determined by governance.

## Token Supply Management Mechanisms

To maintain a balanced and sustainable economy, Orbinum implements several mechanisms to manage the ON token supply:

* **Transaction Fee Burning:** A small percentage of ON tokens used in each network transaction will be permanently removed from circulation. This burn mechanism aims to counteract inflationary pressures as network activity increases. The burn percentage is adjustable via decentralized governance.
* **Treasury Burns:** The network's treasury will periodically conduct burns of ON tokens. The frequency and amount of these burns will be determined by decentralized governance to further manage the total token supply.

## Participant Incentives

* **Validators:** Receive rewards for securing the network through the Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus, validating transactions, verifying AI computations, and their role in AI model operations (training, creation, etc.).
* **Nominators:** Earn passive rewards by delegating their staked ON tokens to trustworthy Validators, thereby enhancing network security.
* **Contributors:** Are incentivized for providing computational resources (CPU/GPU) that power the distributed execution of AI tasks through the model sharding framework.

## Governance of the Economy

All aspects of Orbinum's blockchain economy, including the initial token distribution percentages, the transition to inflation, the annual inflation rate and its cap, dynamic emission adjustments, transaction burn percentages, and treasury burn schedules, are subject to the oversight and decision-making power of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This ensures community control and the ability to adapt the economic model as needed for the network's continued prosperity.
