# What is Orbinum Network?

Orbinum Network is a decentralized ecosystem designed to redefine AI development, deployment, and accessibility by leveraging blockchain technology. By distributing AI training across a network of participating nodes, Orbinum fosters a collaborative, secure, and scalable environment where individuals and organizations can contribute to AI advancements while maintaining full control over their data.

At its core, Orbinum addresses the fundamental limitations of centralized AI models, such as restricted access, privacy concerns, and monopolization by a few entities. Through a decentralized infrastructure, Orbinum ensures that AI innovation remains open and community-driven, allowing for equitable participation in AI model training and utilization.

The network operates on a hybrid consensus mechanism that integrates **Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)** and **Proof of Contribution (PoC)**. This system secures the network while incentivizing meaningful participation, including computational power provision, data contribution, and AI model validation. Built on **Substrate**, Orbinum benefits from seamless upgrades, high efficiency, and interoperability within the broader blockchain ecosystem, including Polkadot.

One of Orbinumâ€™s key innovations is its **Distributed Model Sharding Framework (DMS)**, which partitions AI models into smaller, verifiable fragments stored securely across multiple nodes. This approach enhances security, reduces storage burdens, and improves fault tolerance. Additionally, **Federated Learning** allows AI models to improve collaboratively without requiring centralized data aggregation, ensuring enhanced privacy and security.

Participants in Orbinum can engage in multiple roles, including **validators**, who secure the network and validate AI models, and **nominators**, who support validators through staking and governance. The network also offers a **pay-per-compute model**, enabling users to access high-performance AI processing while maintaining a free-access ecosystem for basic AI services.

Governance in Orbinum is fully decentralized, structured through a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, where validators and nominators participate in decision-making to shape the future of the network. Its economic model follows a **deflationary-to-inflationary transition**, ensuring long-term sustainability through controlled token issuance and burn mechanisms.

By prioritizing decentralization, transparency, and accessibility, Orbinum Network aims to democratize AI, making artificial intelligence an open, community-driven endeavor that fosters global innovation.
